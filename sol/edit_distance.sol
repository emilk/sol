	Function: EditDistance
 
	Finds the edit distance between two strings or tables. Edit distance is the minimum number of
	edits needed to transform one string or table into the other.
	
	Parameters:
	
		s - A *string* or *table*.
		t - Another *string* or *table* to compare against s.
		lim - An *optional number* to limit the function to a maximum edit distance. If specified
			and the function detects that the edit distance is going to be larger than limit, limit
			is returned immediately.
			
	Returns:
	
		A *number* specifying the minimum edits it takes to transform s into t or vice versa. Will
			not return a higher number than lim, if specified.
			
	Example:
 
		:EditDistance( "Tuesday", "Teusday" ) -- One transposition.
		:EditDistance( "kitten", "sitting" ) -- Two substitutions and a deletion.
 
		returns...
 
		:1
		:3
			
	Notes:
	
		* Complexity is O( (#t+1) * (#s+1) ) when lim isn't specified.
		* This function can be used to compare array-like tables as easily as strings.
		* The algorithm used is Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance, which calculates edit distance based
			off number of subsitutions, additions, deletions, and transpositions.
		* Source code for this function is based off the Wikipedia article for the algorithm
			<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance&oldid=351641537>.
		* This function is case sensitive when comparing strings.
		* If this function is being used several times a second, you should be taking advantage of
			the lim parameter.
		* Using this function to compare against a dictionary of 250,000 words took about 0.6
			seconds on my machine for the word "Teusday", around 10 seconds for very poorly 
			spelled words. Both tests used lim.
